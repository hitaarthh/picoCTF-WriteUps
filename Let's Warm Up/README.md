### Information:
If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

### Hint:
Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit ```picoCTF{hello}``` as the flag.

### Solutions:

Found a very familiar hexadecimal value and felt like the flag is the ASCII version of that hexadecimal value. So now there are two ways are to convert into ASCII.

- Write a Python Script for Converting => Made a script for converting from decimal to ASCII which is very similar to this in <a href="https://github.com/hitaarthh/picoCTF-WriteUps/tree/main/Nice%20netcat">Nice NetCat Challenge.</a> )
- Use an Online Converter.

This time we will be using an online converter <a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html">Rapid Tables.</a>

### Flag:
```sh
picoCTF{p}
```
